# Coding Standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use camelCase for variable names and methods.
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants and macros.
- Prefix member variables with an underscore or m_ (e.g., `_userId`, `m_userId`).
- **Prefix static functions with `s_`** (e.g., `s_calculateTotal`, `s_initializeSystem`).
- Use namespaces to organize code logically.

## C++ Features Usage
- Prefer modern C++ features (e.g., auto, range-based loops, smart pointers).
- Use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` for memory management.
- Prefer `std::optional`, `std::variant`, and `std::any` for type-safe alternatives.
- Use `constexpr` and `const` to optimize compile-time computations.
- Use `std::string_view` for read-only string operations to avoid unnecessary copies.

## Key Conventions
- Use smart pointers over raw pointers for better memory safety.
- Avoid global variables; use singletons sparingly.
- Use `enum class` for strongly typed enumerations.
- Separate interface from implementation in classes.
