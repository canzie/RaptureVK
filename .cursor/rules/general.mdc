# General Development Guidelines

## Code Style
- Write concise, idiomatic C++ code with accurate examples.
- Follow modern C++ conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented, procedural, or functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Leverage STL and standard algorithms for collection operations.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'isUserSignedIn', 'calculateTotal').

## Documentation
- Write clear comments for classes, methods, and critical logic.
- Document assumptions, constraints, and expected behavior of code.

## Development Practices
- Do not change parts of the code which the user did not ask for.
- Follow the official ISO C++ standards and guidelines for best practices in modern C++ development.
